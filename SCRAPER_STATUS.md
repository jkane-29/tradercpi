# Scraper Status - Trader Joe's Product Fetch

## 🚀 Currently Running
**Enhanced scraper with pagination** is fetching ALL products from Trader Joe's website.

### Expected Results:
- **~3,034 products** (vs previous 285)
- **99%+ will have prices**
- **Runtime**: 15-30 minutes
- **Started**: October 10, 2025 ~7:46 PM

---

## ✅ How to Check Progress

### Quick Check:
```bash
cd /Users/kaner/tradercpi
./check_progress.sh
```

### Watch Live:
```bash
tail -f pagination_fetch.log
```

### Check if Done:
```bash
ls -lt traderjoes_complete_*.csv
```

---

## 📊 What We Fixed

### The Problem:
- **API returns 15 items per page** by default
- **Old scraper only got page 1** of each category
- **Result**: 285 products out of 3,034 available (10.9%!)

### Example:
- Food category: Had **1,222 products** across **82 pages**
- We were only getting **15 products** (page 1)
- Missing: **1,207 products** from just this category!

### The Solution:
New scraper:
1. ✅ Detects total products per category
2. ✅ Calculates pages needed
3. ✅ Scrolls aggressively to load ALL pages
4. ✅ Clicks "Load More" buttons
5. ✅ Validates complete capture before moving on

## 📁 Output Files (When Complete)

### Main Dataset:
- `traderjoes_complete_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` - **Complete product catalog**

### Columns:
```
sku, retail_price, item_title, inserted_at, store_code,
availability, sales_size, sales_uom_description, published
```

### Raw Data:
- `paginated_responses_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - All API responses

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Store Codes:
- **NOT available** in API responses
- `store_code` column will be **empty**
- API doesn't expose store-specific inventory

### Why?
The public Trader Joe's API shows a generic catalog, not store-specific data. To get store codes, you would need to:
1. Run from different physical locations
2. Use VPN to different cities  
3. Manually assign based on region

---

## 📈 Expected Statistics

Based on API analysis:
- **Total products**: ~3,034
- **With prices**: ~3,000+ (99%+)
- **With sizes**: ~3,000+ (99%+)
- **With availability**: ~3,000+ (99%+)
- **With store codes**: 0 (API limitation)

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### When scraper completes, run:

```bash
# Count total products
wc -l traderjoes_complete_*.csv

# Check data quality
awk -F',' 'NR>1 {
    total++; 
    if($2!="") with_price++; 
    if($6!="") with_avail++
} END {
    print "Total:", total;
    print "With prices:", with_price, "("int(with_price/total*100)"%)";
    print "With availability:", with_avail, "("int(with_avail/total*100"%)")"
}' traderjoes_complete_*.csv

# Show sample
head -20 traderjoes_complete_*.csv
```

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Scraper is successful if:
- ✅ **2,500+ products** captured (vs 285 before)
- ✅ **95%+ have prices**
- ✅ **No errors** in log file
- ✅ CSV file is properly formatted

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Scraper Crashes:
```bash
# Check last error
tail -100 pagination_fetch.log

# Restart scraper
python3 fetch_with_pagination.py
```

### Browser Issues:
```bash
# Reinstall browser
python3 -m playwright install chromium
```

### Only Got ~300 Products:
- Pagination didn't work properly
- Try increasing scroll delays in code
- Or run multiple times and merge results

---

## 📞 Next Steps After Completion

1. **Verify results**: Run verification commands above
2. **Check product count**: Should be 2,500-3,500 products
3. **For store codes**: Decide if you want to:
   - Manually assign a default store (e.g., 546 for Chicago)
   - Run from multiple locations via VPN
   - Use the data without store codes

4. **Use the data**: The complete catalog is ready for your CPI tracker!
