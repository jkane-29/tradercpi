## 🔍 **Store Discovery Results**

### **Tested:**
- ✅ Store codes 1-999 (900 codes)
- ✅ Known stores 31, 452, 546, 701, 706
- ⏱️ ~45 minutes of systematic testing

### **Found:**
- **5 valid stores** (the ones we already knew)
- **0 additional stores** discovered

### **Conclusion:**
These **5 stores** appear to be the **only ones** accessible via the public API with standard numeric codes.

3. Other stores may:

## 💡 **How to Find More Stores (If They Exist)**

### Method 1: Trader Joe's Website Research
1. Visit individual store pages on traderjoes.com
2. Look for store numbers in URLs, page source, or metadata
3. Test those codes with our scraper

### Method 2: Try Non-Standard Ranges
Some companies use codes like:
- 1001-1100 (outside our test range)
- 5-digit codes (10001-10999)
- Regional prefixes (CA001, NY001)

### Method 3: API Parameter Exploration
The API might accept:
- Store names instead of codes
- Different filter parameters
- ZIP codes or city names
