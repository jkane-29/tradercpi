## üåç How Many Stores Could You Get?

### Total Trader Joe's Stores:
Trader Joe's has **~560 stores nationwide** (as of 2024)

### Possible Store Codes:
Based on the pattern (numeric codes), you could potentially query:
- **All 560+ stores** if you can find their codes
- Codes likely range from **1-999**
- Not all numbers are valid (gaps exist)

### How to Discover Them:

**Option 1: Run the Discovery Tool**
```bash
python3 discover_all_stores.py
```
This will:
- Test store codes 1-999
- Find all valid ones
- Show product count for each
- Save results to `valid_store_codes.json`
- **Time**: ~30-60 minutes (tests hundreds of codes)

**Option 2: Use Trader Joe's Store Locator**
Visit: https://locations.traderjoes.com/
- Search by city/zip
- Note the store numbers
- Some stores display their code on the website

**Option 3: Extract from Website Data**
The TJ website might have a store list API endpoint we could query

## üó∫Ô∏è Store Code Patterns (Analysis)

From old data, codes seem to follow patterns:

### Geographic Clustering:
- **1-99**: Early/original stores (East Coast?)
  - 31 = New York
- **400-499**: California/West Coast
  - 452 = San Francisco
- **500-599**: Midwest/Central
  - 546 = Chicago
- **700-799**: California/West Coast
  - 701 = Los Angeles
  - 706 = Brooklyn (possibly renumbered)

### Hypothesis:
Codes might be assigned chronologically (opening order) or by region.

## üìä Product Variation By Store

### What We're Seeing:
- **LA (701)**: 1,552 products
- **NYC (31)**: Fetching now, expecting ~1,550-1,600

### Why Differences?
1. **Regional products** - Some items only in certain regions
2. **Seasonal availability** - Different climates = different seasons
3. **Inventory levels** - Some stores have more SKUs
4. **Local preferences** - Stores stock what sells locally

### Expected Unique Products:
If you fetch all 5 stores:
- **Per store**: ~1,500-1,600 products
- **Total records**: ~7,500-8,000
- **Unique SKUs**: ~1,700-2,000 (many products in multiple stores)
