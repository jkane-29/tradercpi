# Web App Bug Fix Report

## Critical Bug Found and Fixed

**Date:** October 19, 2025

### The Problem
The web app was stuck on the splash screen and never loading the main application.

### Root Cause
**Duplicate Variable Declaration** in the `addToOverlay()` function in `index.html`

- **Line 1680:** `const isMobile = window.innerWidth <= 768;`
- **Line 1704:** `const isMobile = window.innerWidth <= 768;` (DUPLICATE)

In JavaScript, you cannot declare the same `const` variable twice in the same scope. This caused a fatal error that prevented the entire script from executing, leaving users stuck on the splash screen.

### Impact
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- **User Impact:** 100% - Complete application failure
- **Symptoms:** 
  - Splash screen displays but never fades
  - Main app never loads
  - No interactivity
  - No console error message (script fails to parse before execution)

### The Fix
Removed the duplicate `const isMobile` declaration on line 1704, keeping only the first declaration on line 1680. The variable is now declared once and reused.

**Files Fixed:**
- `/Users/kaner/tradercpi/web/index.html`
- `/Users/kaner/tradercpi/index.html`

### Testing Recommendations
1. Open the web app in a browser
2. Verify the splash screen fades out after 2 seconds
3. Verify the main app loads and is interactive
4. Test item search functionality
5. Test basket builder functionality
6. Test on both desktop and mobile viewports

### Prevention
Consider adding:
1. JavaScript linting (ESLint) to catch duplicate variable declarations
2. Automated syntax validation in the build process
3. Browser console error monitoring
4. Unit tests for critical JavaScript functions

### Additional Notes
This bug was likely introduced during a recent refactoring where mobile detection code was added in two places within the same function without noticing the duplicate declaration.
